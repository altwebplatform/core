# AWS-like Services running in your Kubernetes

The combination of Docker and Kubernetes provides an amazing way to run your own platform but are missing key cloud services developers have come to rely on.  You can manually install and configure each of these independently or use AWP, a cohesive distribution of services wrapped up to make your life easier and development run quicker.

## Roadmap
